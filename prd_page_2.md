4. System Architecture (High-Level)
4.1 Platform Layers
A. Local Economies (Worlds)
Each Discord server represents a  sovereign economy  (“World”) with: - Its own currency - Independent
treasury - Governance structure - Finite resources
Failure of one world does not affect others.
B. Global Hub
A  coordination  layer  that  provides:  -  Inter-world  trade  routing  -  Global  identity  (passports)  -  Federal
incentives and treasury routing - Stabilization mechanics
The Global Hub does not control local prices or governance.
C. Reserve Token Layer (Internal)
A fixed-supply reserve asset used for: - Global settlement - Treasury routing - Infrastructure access - Long-
term asset locking
This token has no yield promises  and no profit rights.
5. Platform Interfaces
5.1 Discord (Front-End Interface)
Discord is the command and interaction layer .
Responsibilities:  - Command input (/pay, /invoice, /create_business, etc.) - Status queries (balances, needs,
alerts) - Transaction preparation and redirection
Constraints:  - No execution of transactions - No storage of economic state - Must remain fully Discord TOS-
compliant
5.2 Web Platform (Core Engine)
The website is the system of record.
Responsibilities:  - Execute all transactions - Maintain ledgers and inventories - Apply decay, scarcity, and
penalties - Render dashboards and analytics - Enforce governance and permissions
