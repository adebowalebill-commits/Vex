VexiumVerse — Product Requirements Document
(PRD)
1. Product Overview
VexiumVerse  is a decentralized economic operating system designed to transform online communities
(initially Discord servers) into autonomous, self-sustaining virtual economies governed by scarcity, decay,
production chains, and consequence.
Discord functions as the interaction and command layer , while the web platform acts as the economic
engine , governance system, and analytics layer . All economic activity is simulated and fully compliant with
Discord TOS—no real money or real-world financial instruments are used.
VexiumVerse  is  explicitly  not  a  game  for  fun ,  but  an  economic  simulation  infrastructure  that  can  be
gamified by communities.
2. Product Goals
Primary Goals
Enable Discord communities to operate persistent, governed virtual economies
Enforce real economic pressure through scarcity, decay, and inactivity penalties
Provide transparent governance, treasury, and analytics systems
Secondary Goals
Prevent economic stagnation and infinite-resource collapse
Encourage specialization, trade, and political competition
Allow economies to fail independently without systemic risk
3. Core Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)
Needs must decay
Resources must be scarce
Production must be chained
Inactivity must be punished
Markets must self-balance
All system requirements must reinforce these principles.•

4. System Architecture (High-Level)
4.1 Platform Layers
A. Local Economies (Worlds)
Each Discord server represents a  sovereign economy  (“World”) with: - Its own currency - Independent
treasury - Governance structure - Finite resources
Failure of one world does not affect others.
B. Global Hub
A  coordination  layer  that  provides:  -  Inter-world  trade  routing  -  Global  identity  (passports)  -  Federal
incentives and treasury routing - Stabilization mechanics
The Global Hub does not control local prices or governance.
C. Reserve Token Layer (Internal)
A fixed-supply reserve asset used for: - Global settlement - Treasury routing - Infrastructure access - Long-
term asset locking
This token has no yield promises  and no profit rights.
5. Platform Interfaces
5.1 Discord (Front-End Interface)
Discord is the command and interaction layer .
Responsibilities:  - Command input (/pay, /invoice, /create_business, etc.) - Status queries (balances, needs,
alerts) - Transaction preparation and redirection
Constraints:  - No execution of transactions - No storage of economic state - Must remain fully Discord TOS-
compliant
5.2 Web Platform (Core Engine)
The website is the system of record.
Responsibilities:  - Execute all transactions - Maintain ledgers and inventories - Apply decay, scarcity, and
penalties - Render dashboards and analytics - Enforce governance and permissions

6. User Roles & Permissions
6.1 Protocol (VexiumVerse)
Issues server licenses
Collects protocol fees
Provides infrastructure
Cannot set local prices
6.2 Server Owner (National Government)
Capabilities:  - Create and register a world - Set tax bands (within protocol limits) - Appoint or enable
elections for mayors - Control national treasury spending
6.3 Mayor (Regional Government)
Capabilities:  -  Control  land  distribution  -  Set  permit  and  license  pricing  -  Manage  regional  resource
extraction - Compete for population and industry
Poor governance leads to migration and capital flight.
6.4 Business Owner
Capabilities:  - Operate production or service businesses - Manage payroll, inventory, and P&L - Participate
in production chains
Businesses cannot consume their own outputs.
6.5 Citizen
Capabilities:  - Maintain survival needs - Earn income via labor or ownership - Spend currency on goods and
services
7. Survival & Pressure Mechanics
Each citizen has three decaying needs: - Food - Water - Sleep
Effects of Neglect:  - Reduced productivity - Inability to operate businesses - Restricted movement or work
These mechanics ensure mandatory spending and continuous demand.•

8. Resource & Production System
8.1 Finite Resources
Each region contains capped extractable resources: - Oil - Wood - Metal - Gold
Extraction is rate-limited per cycle.
8.2 Production Chains
Raw resources must be processed through multiple businesses.
Examples:  - Oil → Refinery → Fuel → Gas Station → Transport - Metal → Machinery → Vehicles → Logistics -
Crops → Grocery → Consumers
This enforces interdependence and trade.
9. Core Business Categories (MVE)
A minimum viable economy includes:
Survival & Utilities
Water Purification
Farm
Grocery Store
Resource Extraction
Mining
Oil Drilling
Processing
Oil Refinery
Machinery Manufacturing
Logistics & Mobility
Trucking Company
Vehicle Dealership•

10. Banking & Credit System
Banking is infrastructure, not a player-owned business.
Players
Wallet balance
Bank account
Transaction history
Businesses
Dedicated wallets
Payroll tracking
Profit & loss tracking
Credit
Loans issued only by treasuries
Asset-backed or reputation-backed
Defaults trigger liquidation or penalties

Protocol incentives
Treasury Spending
Infrastructure subsidies
Emergency imports
Business loans
Public works
All treasuries are transparent and auditable.
13. Inactivity & Enforcement Mechanics
Inactivity triggers: - Permit revocation - Forced asset sales or auctions - Emergency licensing to other
players
These prevent economic dead zones.
14. Dashboards
Economy (Server Owner)
Money supply
Resource availability
Production throughput
Population trends
Treasury health
Regional (Mayor)

Resource extraction
Migration metrics
Business
Inventory

17. Summary
VexiumVerse is an economic operating system for online communities, enforcing real economic constraints
through governance, scarcity, decay, and consequence. Discord serves as the interaction layer , while the
web  platform  acts  as  the  authoritative  economic  engine,  enabling  resilient,  self-balancing  virtual
economies.•
