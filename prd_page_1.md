VexiumVerse — Product Requirements Document
(PRD)
1. Product Overview
VexiumVerse  is a decentralized economic operating system designed to transform online communities
(initially Discord servers) into autonomous, self-sustaining virtual economies governed by scarcity, decay,
production chains, and consequence.
Discord functions as the interaction and command layer , while the web platform acts as the economic
engine , governance system, and analytics layer . All economic activity is simulated and fully compliant with
Discord TOS—no real money or real-world financial instruments are used.
VexiumVerse  is  explicitly  not  a  game  for  fun ,  but  an  economic  simulation  infrastructure  that  can  be
gamified by communities.
2. Product Goals
Primary Goals
Enable Discord communities to operate persistent, governed virtual economies
Enforce real economic pressure through scarcity, decay, and inactivity penalties
Provide transparent governance, treasury, and analytics systems
Secondary Goals
Prevent economic stagnation and infinite-resource collapse
Encourage specialization, trade, and political competition
Allow economies to fail independently without systemic risk
3. Core Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)
Needs must decay
Resources must be scarce
Production must be chained
Inactivity must be punished
Markets must self-balance
All system requirements must reinforce these principles.•
